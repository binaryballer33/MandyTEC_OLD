# OLD MANDYTEC,

### This is back when we use to make websites this way, with all the HTML, CSS, Image files and Bootstrap 4

### I'm so happy because I've come a long way from where I was ðŸ™‚

### This is not REALLY a React app, haha I just stuck everything inside a blank react setup, so I can host this old girl on my domain

### Gotta keep going!!! ðŸ™‚ ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ˜ˆ
### #Love Coding
